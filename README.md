# Udacity AWS Cloud Devops Engineer Nanodegree Program
Learn to design and deploy infrastructure as code, build and monitor CI/CD pipelines for different deployment strategies, and deploy scalable microservices using Kubernetes. At the end of the program, you’ll combine your new skills by completing a capstone project.

## PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
You should have intermediate knowledge of Javascript, and familiarity with object-oriented programming, web development with HTML and CSS, and the Linux Command Line. 

# Cloud Foundations
Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to compute power, security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud.

## PROJECT 1
## Deploy a Static Website on AWS
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. First, you will create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWS’s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.

## Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
In this course, you’ll learn how to deploy the underlying infrastructure components that provide security and services to our servers by writing scripts using CloudFormation, AWS’ tool for Infrastructure as Code. You will use CloudFormation to deploy Infrastructure patterns that are used in the industry broadly and can be readily used to deploy any cloud application. Like in the real world, you will begin with initial business requirements that you will turn into Cloud Architecture Diagrams. Then you will deploy this architecture using CloudFormation.

## PROJECT 2
## Deploy a High-Availability Web App Using CloudFormation
In this project, you’ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. You will write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for Instagram-like app from the ground up. You will begin with deploying the networking components followed by servers, security roles and software. The procedure you follow here will become part of your portfolio of cloud projects -- You’ll do it exactly as it’s done on the job: following best practices and scripting as much as possible.

# Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging
Learn how to stretch for Continuous Delivery as your “true north” while you build CI/CD systems that automate the “stuff” between developers and the cloud. You’ll gain essential knowledge and put it into practice as you learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. You’ll combine your existing knowledge of Cloud Formation and AWS with new tools like Ansible and Circle CI. You’ll also learn how to keep an eye on your deployments with proactive monitoring and alerting.

## PROJECT 3
## Build an automated CI/CD Pipeline for UdaPeople
In this project, you’ll demonstrate your Cloud DevOps engineer skills as a new employee at UdaPeople, an innovative new Human Resources company that depends on quick release cycles and a rock solid, high-quality product. You will help the development team deliver value continuously by building an automated CI/CD pipeline. Those new skills will also be put to the test as you set up automated monitoring and alerting to ensure the delivered value stays valuable. Thanks to your new skills and hard work, UdaPeople will have a massive competitive advantage in the PeopleOps marketplace and will surely go on to change the world!

# Microservices at Scale using Kubernetes
In this course, you learn to create and deploy a kubernetes cluster, configure kubernetes autoscale and load test a kubernetes application. You’ll learn to operationalize both existing and new microservices and apply containers best practices. You’ll learn to deploy Machine Learning microservices that are elastic and fault tolerant. You’ll learn to pick the appropriate abstraction for microservices: Serverless (AWS Lambda) or Container Orchestration (Kubernetes).
 
## PROJECT 4
## Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API
In this project, you will continue your work on operationalizing microservices by deploying an elastic and fault-tolerant Machine Learning inference API using Kubernetes. You’ll configure this microservice to be highly available by using Kubernetes best practices. You will validate your design by load testing the service and verifying the application architecture performs as designed.

## PROJECT 5
## Capstone Project
In the capstone project, each project is unique to the student. You’ll build a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application for different deployment strategies. Students define the scope of the project and select the right deployment strategy based on different business requirements.
